I have some experience with the shell. It was the first tool I used frequently when I started teaching myself web
development. I prefer it to GUIs at times since GUIs can be distracting.

I picked python up a few months ago and want to move my whole stack to it. I find it easy to learn and easy to teach.

I have not used git before this class so this will be my first time formally using git.
